## ðŸ§  State Management

The application uses a reducer to manage all task-related operations, with actions defined in `ConstantsType.ts`. It supports the following action types:

- `ADD_TASK`
- `DELETE_TASK`
- `COMPLETE_TASK`
- `START_EDIT_MODE`
- `CANCEL_EDIT_MODE`
- `SAVE_EDIT_MODE`

State is persisted in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `tasks_state`.
